## The Issue

This api call to the [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) service works as expected using MRI ruby-1.9.3-p429 but not when using MRI ruby-2.0.0-p195.

This gist shows the code and the response when using 1.9.3 and 2.0.0.

The code sample is taken directly from the Weather Underground's [documentation](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=resources/code-samples#ruby)
